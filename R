Simple I-Declare-War iOS game

Uses Swift 2 and Xcode 7

The user and the "computer" compete to see which card was larger. Both the user and the computer draw from a "deck" of cards at random. The deck and random card are simulated through using a arc4random operator to choose a card from the deck. This simulates shuffling the deck, therefore making each draw random. When the deal button is pressed, both the user and the computer are given a card each at random. Both cards are displayed face-up in order to show the user who won the round. The winner's score is then incremented by one for each win.
